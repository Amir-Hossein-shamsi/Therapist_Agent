# üß† Therapist Agent

Welcome to **Therapist Agent** ‚Äì an intelligent conversational agent that dynamically adapts its responses based on the user's emotional or logical needs. Powered by [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph), and [Groq LLMs](https://console.groq.com/), Decomond can act as both a compassionate therapist and a purely logical assistant.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Message Classification:**  
  Detects whether a user's message requires an _emotional_ or _logical_ response using an LLM-based classifier.

- **Dual-Persona Response:**

  - **Therapist Agent:** Offers empathy, emotional support, and thoughtful questions.
  - **Logical Agent:** Delivers factual, concise, and direct answers without emotional context.

- **Stateful Conversation:**  
  Maintains conversation history and adapts responses accordingly.

- **Easy to Run:**  
  Simple CLI interface for interactive chatting.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The agent's flow is managed by a [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) state machine:

1. **Classification:**  
   Each user message is classified as either `emotional` or `logical` by an LLM.

2. **Routing:**  
   Based on the classification, the message is routed to either the therapist or logical agent.

3. **Response Generation:**

   - **Therapist Agent:** Responds with empathy and emotional support.
   - **Logical Agent:** Responds with facts and logical reasoning.

4. **Conversation Loop:**  
   The process repeats for each new user message.
